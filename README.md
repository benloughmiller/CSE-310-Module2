# Overview

This software uses the Google Maps API to serve as a basic route finder. You can enter a starting point, any waypoints that you would like, and a destination, and the program will find an optimized route for you to follow. It will also save the route in your browser's history so that you can load the route later. It also keeps a tally of how many routes you've generated. 

This program is designed to be an introductory program to using the Google Maps API.
Many programs use it in their navigation features, and it is a useful skill to know.

# Development Environment

I used vanilla JavaScript for the backend of this program and HTML/CSS for the front end. I utilized the Google Maps API for navigating and displaying routes.
